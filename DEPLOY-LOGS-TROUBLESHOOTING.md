# üö® DIGITAL OCEAN DEPLOY LOGS ISSUE - TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
*Generated: August 17, 2025 - 10:50 AM*

## üîç **ISSUE: Unable to get deploy logs for component "mdcanreg-cert"**

This error typically indicates one of several possible deployment issues:

### üö® **POSSIBLE CAUSES**

1. **Build Process Failing Early** - The build is failing before logs can be generated
2. **Component Name Mismatch** - The component name in the configuration might not match
3. **Resource Exhaustion During Build** - Build process running out of memory/CPU
4. **Network/Connectivity Issues** - Digital Ocean having trouble accessing the repository
5. **Configuration File Issues** - Problems with `.do/app.yaml` configuration

### üõ†Ô∏è **IMMEDIATE TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS**

#### **Step 1: Verify Component Configuration**
Check if the component name in `.do/app.yaml` matches Digital Ocean expectations.

Current configuration:
```yaml
services:
- name: mdcanreg-cert  # ‚Üê This should match the logs component name
```

#### **Step 2: Simplify Deployment Configuration**
Let's create a minimal, bulletproof configuration to ensure deployment succeeds.

#### **Step 3: Check Repository Access**
Ensure Digital Ocean can access the GitHub repository and the latest commits.

#### **Step 4: Create Fallback Deployment Options**
Provide multiple deployment strategies in case the current approach fails.

## üîß **IMMEDIATE FIXES TO IMPLEMENT**

### **Fix 1: Simplify .do/app.yaml Configuration**
Remove any complex features that might cause build failures:

### **Fix 2: Create Ultra-Simple Dockerfile**  
Strip down to absolute basics to ensure build succeeds:

### **Fix 3: Add Build Debugging**
Add explicit build steps that will show up in logs:

### **Fix 4: Create Health Check for Build Process**
Add build-time verification that will help identify issues:

## ‚ö° **EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT STRATEGIES**

### **Strategy A: Minimal Configuration Deploy**
1. Temporarily simplify all configurations
2. Remove all optional features  
3. Deploy with basic functionality only
4. Add features back incrementally

### **Strategy B: Alternative Entry Points**
1. Use multiple possible app entry points
2. Add extensive fallback mechanisms
3. Include detailed error reporting

### **Strategy C: Manual Container Build**
1. Build container locally first
2. Test container before deployment
3. Push pre-built container to registry

## üéØ **NEXT ACTIONS RECOMMENDED**

1. **Implement Simplified Configuration** (Immediate)
2. **Create Minimal Dockerfile** (High Priority) 
3. **Add Build Debugging** (High Priority)
4. **Test Alternative Entry Points** (Medium Priority)
5. **Monitor Digital Ocean Status** (Ongoing)

## üìã **DIAGNOSTIC CHECKLIST**

- [ ] Component name matches in all configuration files
- [ ] Repository is accessible and latest commits are pushed
- [ ] Dockerfile builds successfully locally
- [ ] All required files are present in repository
- [ ] Environment variables are properly configured
- [ ] Resource limits are appropriate for build process

This issue suggests we need to make the deployment process more robust and debuggable.
